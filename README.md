#Weather Forecast using Gulp
An angular single page app forked from a sample on [Anthony Alicea](https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/)'s Learn and Understand AngularJS course at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

The goal of this project is to adapt a simple and working AngularJS app to the following tools and resources:

* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* Concat.
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)

#Project Structure
The code is divided in 2 directories:

* vanilla: the app running as it was gave on the course.
* gulp: the adapted version of the app using gulp and so on..


#Dependencies:
* npm
* gulp
* gulp-ruby-sass
* gulp-sourcemaps
